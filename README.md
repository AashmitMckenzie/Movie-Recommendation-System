In this age of entertainment consumption, navigating oneâ€™s way can be a tedious task considering the vast array of movies available on the net. To address this challenge, we have created a movie recommendation system that integrates data from various leading platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes.

Existing sites often fall short in this aspect and fail to give an aggregate rating and a curated list of specific genres. By simplifying the process of discovering quality cinematic offerings, such a system aims to enhance the movie-watching experience for audiences worldwide.

Our project aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by using various data management and analysis techniques to calculate average ratings and generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences and past ratings.
